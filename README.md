## AB Testing Project

This project focuses on analyzing the results of an A/B test conducted by GloBox, an e-commerce company specializing in sourcing unique and high-quality products from around the world.

## A/B Testing Overview

A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage, advertisement, or product feature to determine which one performs better. It involves splitting users into two groups, the control group and the test group, and exposing each group to a different version of the feature. By measuring the performance of each version, businesses can make data-driven decisions to optimize their offerings.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze the results of an A/B test conducted by GloBox to evaluate the effectiveness of highlighting key products in the food and drink category as a banner at the top of their mobile website. 

## Project Logistics

The project consists of three parts:

1. **Review Inferential Statistics and Create Analysis Plan:** Review inferential statistics concepts and create an analysis plan for the A/B test.
2. **Analyze A/B Test Results:** Analyze the results of the A/B test to determine its success.
3. **Record Presentation and Create Written Report:** Record a presentation of the A/B test results and create a written report summarizing the findings.

## Tools and Skills

- **Statistical Analysis:** Inferential statistics for analyzing A/B test results.
- **Data Visualization:** Presenting findings visually through graphs and charts.
- **Presentation Skills:** Recording a presentation to communicate findings effectively.
- **Report Writing:** Summarizing findings and recommendations in a written report.
